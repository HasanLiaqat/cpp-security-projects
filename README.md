# C++ Cryptography Projects

This repository contains three C++ security projects:

1. **Cipher Encryption/Decryption** – Simple text-based encryption.
2. **XOR with Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** – Encrypt/decrypt text using XOR and DH key exchange.
3. **RSA Encryption** – Implementation of RSA public-key encryption.

Each project has its own folder with source code.
